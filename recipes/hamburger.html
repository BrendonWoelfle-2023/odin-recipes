    <h2><u>Description:</u></h2>

    <p>Hamburgers have been a American favorite meal for as long as cows have been alive.
        I am personally in love with this meal, expecially when the side is french fries!</p>

    <p>Below you will see exactly how a hamburger is made, and I am super excited to share with you how this meal comes together.  </p>

    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong> These basic burgers start with 1 1/2 pounds of lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion:</strong> A finely chopped onion takes the flavor up a notch</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong>You'll need shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong>An egg lends moisture and helps bind the patties together. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings, Herbs, Sauces:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Dry onion soup mix</li>
            <li>Fresh garlic</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>dried parsley</li>
            <li>Dried basil</li>
            <li>Dried oregano</li>
            <li>Crushed dried rosemary</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix, minced garlic, garlic powder,
            soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
            Use your hands to form the mixture into 4 patties.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 
            4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 
            degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>

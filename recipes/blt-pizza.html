    <h2><u>Description:</u></h2>

    <p>The classic BLT sandwich favorite is reincarnated as a pizza. Bacon and tomatoes are baked onto a pizza crust, 
        then topped with seasoned shredded lettuce to make an unforgettably fun meal.</p>

    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices bacon</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust dough</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), or according to package directions for pizza dough.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place bacon in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat; fry until browned, but not crisp. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stretch pizza dough out over a pizza stone, pan, or cookie sheet. Brush dough with olive oil. Spread mozzarella cheese over crust and arrange tomatoes on top. Chop bacon and sprinkle evenly over pizza.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake pizza for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is golden and cheese is melted in the center. Meanwhile, toss shredded lettuce with mayonnaise; season lightly with salt and pepper. Top finished pizza with dressed lettuce and serve immediately.</li>

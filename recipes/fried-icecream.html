    <h2><u>Description:</u></h2>

    <p>This fried ice cream is crunchy outside and smooth and creamy inside. Serve with whipped cream, honey, and cherries.</p>

    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>

        <li>1 quart vanilla ice cream</li>
        <li>3 cups crushed cornflakes cereal</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>

    </ul>

    <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
